# Dart Programs



## Program 1: Display Personal Information
Wrote a Dart program using variables to display my name, age, school, and a hobby. Print it in one logical sentence.

## Program 2: Perform Mathematical Operations with Functions
- Was to write Dart program that performs two mathematical operations using functions.
 - added some more math operations to enhance user experience

## Program 3: Determine Grade Based on Marks
Wrote a Dart program to determine the grade based on a student's marks. The program should print out the appropriate grade according to the following criteria:
## I added the feature that the program should calcute the grade base on the average marks
- If the average marks greater than 85, print "Excellent".
- If the average marks between 75 and 85 (inclusive), print "Very Good".
- If the average marks between 65 and 75 (inclusive), print "Good".
- If the average marks are below 65, print "Average".

## Feature
- The program ask for user to input marks for 3 subjects
- the average is auto calculated and the student is graded by the system
